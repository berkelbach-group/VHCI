These are three example calculations for a 6-atom molecule, acetonitrile (CH3CN).

We use a quartic potential energy surface from Begue et al. (10.1063/1.2795711). 

The all input files are set to calculate the 20 lowest eigenstates of acetonitrile.  
VCI generates a CI basis of product states up to 6 quanta per state.  VHCI
initializes the calculation with up to 2 quanta per product state and performs an
iterative heat-bath calculation with variational cutoff parameter eps1=1 cm^-1.  
VHCI+PT2 initializes in the same way with eps1=1 cm^-1, and then performs a full 
PT2 correction.

Once the code is compiled, it can be run with the following command:
dir/vhci -n Ncpu -i acetonitrile.inp -o freqs.dat

where dir is the directory containing the vhci executable.

Each example directory contains the expected frequency results file (freqs.dat) 
and the expected output to the terminal (output.log).

The results of VHCI and VHCI+PT2 should match those in Table I of Fetherolf
& Berkelbach.
