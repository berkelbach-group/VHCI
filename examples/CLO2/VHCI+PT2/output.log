Reading input...

No fatal errors detected.
 And there was much rejoicing. Yay...

No checkpoint filename specified. Checkpoints will not be saved.

 Constructing Hamiltonian...The Hamiltonian is 57.53% sparse.
 Finding the first 20 eigenstates...
 ZPE is: 1264.49

 Performing HCI iteration: 2
 Basis size after iteration 2 is: 390
 Constructing Hamiltonian...The Hamiltonian is 62.52% sparse.
 Finding the first 20 eigenstates...
 ZPE is: 1264.49

 Performing HCI iteration: 3
 Basis converged after 2 iterations and contains 390 product states.
 Variational stage took 0.00 seconds

Performing Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory...
 Including all connected states in PT2 calculation.
 Finding connected states...
 Perturbative space contains 962 states.
 Calculating the 2nd-order perturbative correction for on first 20 eigenvalues.
 New ZPE after PT2 correction is: 1264.49
Printing the results...

Results:
  Zero-point energy: 1264.49 (1/cm)
  Run time: 0.00 seconds

Done.
