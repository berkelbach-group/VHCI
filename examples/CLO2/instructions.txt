These are three example calculations for a 3-atom molecule, ClO2.

We use a 6th-order potential energy surface from K.A. Peterson (10.1063/1.477558) 
which was converted to a 6th-order normal mode expansion by the PyPES software 
(10.1002/jcc.24192). 

The all input files are set to calculate the 20 lowest eigenstates of ClO2.  VCI 
generates a CI basis of product states up to 25 quanta per state.  VHCI
initializes the calculation with up to 8 quanta per product state and performs an
iterative heat-bath calculation with variational cutoff parameter eps1=0.01 cm^-1.  
VHCI+PT2 initializes in the same way, but only uses eps1=0.1 cm^-1, and then 
performs a full PT2 correction.

Once the code is compiled, it can be run with the following command:
dir/vhci -n Ncpu -i CLO2.inp -o freqs.dat

where dir is the directory containing the vhci executable and Ncpu is the number of 
CPU cores you want to use.

Each example directory contains the expected frequency results file (freqs.dat) 
and the expected output to the terminal (output.log).
